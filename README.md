# Python-Temperature-Converter
January Challenge from Michigan Python User Group

The "Mod1" python file contains code that generates a simple temperature converter.  Users can use the menu options to convert Farenheit to Celsius and vice versa.  This code was originally completed as part of the Michigan Python user group January challenge and later used as a sample script in my current graduate course.  This code is open for use or reference.

Please note, this is my first GitHub repository so I am open to feedback!
